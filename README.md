Data Analysis/Visualization in R on meteor showers dataset


Examined a cleaned dataset of meteor shower data to try to determine whether or not the four types of undifferentiated meteorites (carbonaceous, ordinary, Rumuruti (R), Enstatite) all have the same mass. Used a one-way ANOVA statistical test and pairwise T-test at the alpha = 0.05 significance level. Coded in R language.
