One way ANOVA and pairwise T-test on meteor dataset to determine whether mass is the same among all undifferentiated meteorite subtypes


Examined a cleaned dataset of meteor shower data to try to determine whether or not the four types of undifferentiated meteorites (carbonaceous, ordinary, Rumuruti (R), Enstatite) all have the same mass. Used a one-way ANOVA statistical test and pairwise T-test at the alpha = 0.05 significance level. Coded in R language.
